This is a complete rebuild/rewrite of Incoming-BG. There is a new GUI, and now you can choose what messages you want to use. I have now made it to where the GUI will appear when you log in. There is an Exit button to close out the addon. Whenever you need it again just make sure to use /inc and the GUI will pop up wherever you last had it anchored.

 

* Have even been in a situation in a BG or Epic BG to where you don't have time to type out that there is an INC at your location/flag? Stopping to type out your message for your group will take away from you defending the flag. 

 

* Playing any type of PVP is usually fast paced and there isn't room for mistakes. Taking time to type things out takes too much time to do. Well this addon will make it to where you do NOT have to type anything to call out an INC. All you have to do is click on the appropriate button to call out the INC for you. 

 

* Examples of Buttons:  SEE IMAGES

1, 2, 3, 4, and Zerg: (you choose the number) at your location. Example if you press 2- " 2 Alliance at LightHouse" or whatever your location is. Or if you press 4 "4 Hordies at WaterWorks"  Or, whatever your location is.  In another words, whatever fraction you are will determine if the message says Alliance or Hordies. ( these are hard coded and will remain what they are)

All Clear at your location: ( you can choose between 3 different messages)

Incoming at your location: ( you can choose between 3 different messages)

Send More to your location: ( you can choose between 3 different messages)

 

*This addon works in BG's that have "zones". If the BG doesn't have zones it will NOT work. The only BG's that I have found that it doesn't work on is ASHRAN and SEETHING SHORE. that's because they have no zones. All you are doing is killing the enemy boss. And just fighting for Azerite. 

 

Use: The GUI will appear when you log in. If you exit the addon you must either use /inc. Or you can /reload. Whatever position you had the GUI on screen is where it will appear. If you change any of the Send More, INC, or All Clear messages they will be saved.
